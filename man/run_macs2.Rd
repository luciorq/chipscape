}
\arguments{
\item{sample_name}{The name of the sample. This value will be used
as the prefix for the output files and output directory.}

\item{treatment_bam}{The path to the treatment BAM file. This argument
accepts a vector of paths.}

\item{control_bam}{The path to the control BAM file. If \code{NULL} then
no control is used. This argument accepts a vector of paths.}

\item{cutoff}{The cutoff to use for peak calling. Defaults to \code{0.05}.}

\item{broad_cutoff}{The cutoff to use for broad peak calling.
Defaults to \code{0.1}.}

\item{broad}{Logical. Whether to call broad peaks. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{model}{Logical. Whether to model the fragment length.
For paired-end samples this should be \code{FALSE}. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{bedgraph}{Logical. Whether to output the bedgraph file.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{genome}{The genome to use. Defaults to \code{hs}. If a non-model organism is
used, please use the genome length as stated in MACS2 documentation.}

\item{input_format}{The input format. Defaults to \code{BAMPE} for BAM from
paired-end experiment. Other options are are stated in the MACS2
documentation.}

\item{env_name}{The name of the Conda environment to use.}
